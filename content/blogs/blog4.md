Hi, I'm Jefin Joseph, a Masters in Management student at London Business School.

Before LBS, I worked as a marketing consultant at a London-based content marketing agency. I mostly worked with Saas clients on long-form content generation and SEO.

Prior to my marketing stint, I was a software engineer at IQVIA. I did software testing and development for big pharma clients.

I was born in India and brought up in Saudi Arabia.

I look forward to the new experiences that London offers!
